              <p>Hired as a contractor to evaluate and provide a plan for cleaning up a number of legacy Python systems. Spent time standardizing deployment and provisioning of Ubuntu virtual machines using Fabric and Puppet. Built deployment framework with Fabric used to deploy vanilla python applications, python packages to a local PyPI instance and Django applications. Standardized on tools for application hosting such as Supervisor for process management, gunicorn for WSGI applications Sentry for error reporting and nginx as a webserver. Set up local git repository hosting through gitolite. Rebuilt ETL system used to gather billing data from various external datasources (FTPs, websites and local servers), process them and upload them to an FTP to be billed out to individual customers. ETL system used CouchDB as a hub for all stages of the process: storage of all files retrieved (via document attachments), event processing (via changes api) and reporting and monitoring of the system. Mentored new hire just starting as a software engineer on best practices around source control, development philosophy, tool choices, testing, etc.</p>

              <p>Worked on two distinct platforms serving a very similar purpose acting as landing pages for SEM campaigns centered around customer acquisition for clients in a variety of verticals. One written on top of Django and the other on top of Rails. Both interacted with a variety of services including a messaging system (RabbitMQ over AMQP), datastores (Postgres, Redis) and web services (both internal and external). Developed features for both platforms which responded to both client needs and needs from internal partners (primarily front-end developers). Wrote tests for both using popular test frameworks for Ruby (RSpec, Shoulda, Cucumber, TestUnit) and Python (unittest, nose). Helped maintain many internal packages that facilitated code sharing amongst the various code bases.</p>
