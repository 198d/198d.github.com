Hi, my name is John. I'm a software engineer currently residing in Chicago, IL writing
mostly [Ruby][1] with a slight emphasis on [Rails][2]. Occasionally I get to write 
a little [Python][3] and toy with [Django][4].

Lately I've been interested in stuff like large [distributed][5] [sysems][6], 
[non-relational][7] [data][8] [stores][9], and new [programming][10] [languages][11].

I decided I needed some sort of 'landing page' on the internet and figured while I was 
at it, I'd start writing a blog. The site is powered by [jekyll][12] and hosted on 
[Amazon S3][13] and is even [open source][14].

Now maybe I'll write something interesting...
